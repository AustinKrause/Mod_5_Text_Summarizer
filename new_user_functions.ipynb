Atkinson has said that she loves Netflix, attributes the same feeling to Brodie, and has had a previous Brodie book, “Case Histories,” adapted for PBS. There is no stray anything in “Big Sky.” That’s one big reason Atkinson’s devotees love her. Brodie has been Atkinson’s most popular character for good reason.

      "summary: Advertisement Supported by By Maggie Haberman, Annie Karni and Michael D. Shear ORLANDO, Fla. — President Trump delivered a fierce denunciation of the news media, the political establishment and what he called his radical opponents on Tuesday as he opened his re-election campaign in front of a huge crowd of raucous supporters by evoking the dark messaging and personal grievances that animated his 2016 victory. Almost four years to the day since he announced his first, improbable run for public office from the basement of Trump Tower in Manhattan, Mr. Trump mocked and disparaged Democrats, calling them the leaders of an “angry, left-wing mob” and declaring that the 2020 election will be a “verdict on the un-American conduct of those who tried to undermine our great democracy, undermine you.” He extolled his record as president — the growing economy, the tax cuts and deregulation — but did not offer any new policies or a cohesive agenda for a second term that might expand his political appeal. “Our political opponents look down with hatred on our values and with utter disdain for the people whose lives they want to run,” Mr. Trump told a packed arena, later mocking Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a Democratic rival for the presidency, as “Sleepy Joe.” [Fact-checking Trump’s campaign kickoff rally: Russia, the wall and more.] He said the Democratic position on immigration was “the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and, frankly, American life.” But for Mr. Trump, the rally was the beginning of what polls suggest will be a difficult 18 months as he seeks another four years in the White House. Instead, Mr. Trump is betting that the 2020 campaign will be a “Back to the Future” replay of the 2016 one, when a reality TV star and New York real estate mogul campaigned as a disrupter with nothing to lose and shook the political establishment to its core. Some had been die-hard supporters since Mr. Trump opened his previous bid in 2015. Without a new message or a clear agenda for a second term, Mr. Trump’s advisers are banking on the belief that the same basic playbook — Mr. Trump’s preternatural ability to shock and entertain — will again animate his core voters and retain the swing voters who gambled on him in 2016. “We are going to keep on working,” Mr. Trump vowed.\n",

      "summary: Advertisement Supported by By Nick Cumming-Bruce GENEVA — Saudi Arabia is responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in its Istanbul consulate last year, and there is “credible evidence” justifying an investigation into the role of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, a United Nations expert said in a report released on Wednesday. “There is credible evidence warranting further investigation of high-level Saudi officials’ individual liability, including the crown prince’s,” Ms. Callamard said in a 100-page report, issued after a five-month investigation. Saudi officials said at first that Mr. Khashoggi had left the consulate alive and denied any knowledge of his whereabouts, but they later admitted that he had been killed in the building after what they said was a botched mission to bring him back to Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi’s killing constituted an extrajudicial killing for which the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible,” and may also have been an act of torture under international treaties, Ms. Callamard wrote. Ms. Callamard also called on the international community to impose targeted sanctions on Saudi officials said to have been involved in the murder, including Prince Mohammed. The sanctions should focus on the prince’s personal assets abroad “until and unless evidence has been produced that he bears no responsibility for the execution of Mr. Khashoggi.” Ms. Callamard is to present her findings to the Human Rights Council in Geneva next week in a session that will also be addressed by Ms. Cengiz, Mr. Khashoggi’s fiancé.\n",

He told the North Koreans that if the U.S. was forced to defend itself and its allies from a missile attack, “we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” And regarding Iran, he tweeted, “If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran.” Wow — the official end of Iran! What we are seeing in the case of Iran and North Korea are all the weaknesses of having a president who on some foreign policy issues has the right instincts — as in the need to confront China on trade or a desire to improve the Iran deal — but who embarks on initiatives without a thought-through plan or clear-cut end goals, without a strong national security team to implement what he wants, without a broad coalition of allies needed to sustain any long confrontation, and without even the remotest understanding of one of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’s cardinal rules of warfare: “The enemy gets a vote.” Let’s break all of this down. Do you have any idea if Trump’s goal in either Iran or North Korea is, as Robert Litwak, the Wilson Center’s expert on rogue states, has asked, “transformational regime change” or a “transactional deal,” whereby we would actually have to give up something in order to get something in return. After Trump withdrew America from the Iran nuclear deal — even though Iran was abiding by its terms — his ambitious, sycophantic secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, gave a speech listing the 12 ways Iran had to change at home and abroad — demands that were tantamount to regime change. As with Iran, Litwak says, the way out of the North Korea impasse is to pivot from the transformational goal — complete denuclearization up front — to the transactional — a verified freeze of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and missile program to prevent a bad situation from getting worse. Had Trump limited himself to a good little fix of the Iran deal that would have kept Iran’s nuclear program on ice for 25 years, had he not set out to transform Iran to prove that he could radically outdo Obama, we’d be in a lot better place than we are now. So memo to Trump: If you want to one-up Obama, the only way you’re going to do it is at the negotiating table, where, to succeed, you’ll have to strike the same kind of transactional deal that Obama did.\n",

Mr. Jassy said the company would double down on the deployment of the new product, a growing business for Amazon, despite increasing worries, including from some of its own employees, about how it could be abused. “I strongly believe that just because tech could be misused doesn’t mean we should ban it and condemn it,” said Mr. Jassy, urging the federal government to create a national law to govern its use if it was concerned. Appearing after Mr. Jassy, Mr. Ryan said he was struck by the attitude of too many tech execs like him, especially given how high the stakes are as the situation at the border becomes ever more dire. Pointing out that companies like Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, Palantir and others have been supplying the immigration agencies with all kinds of software, devices and services, some of which may have been used to help separate children from their families, Mr. Ryan said he was perplexed as to why tech companies did not have more of an ethical conscience. “I think that what the companies right now that are holding the power need to recognize is that the government could not do what it is doing now without them,” he said. Mr. Ryan’s colleague Erika Andiola noted that the tech companies’ tools are helping a “machine of deportation.” “If tech wants to walk hand in hand with our government in this experiment in tyranny,” Mr. Ryan told the crowd, “then go for it.” But, if you want to use Mr. Jassy’s metaphor instead, tech might want to consider this: Trying to catch these kinds of falling knives — and fall they will eventually — is likely to be pretty painful.\n",

But the new details — some of which have been reported by news outlets including BuzzFeed and Reuters over the last year — show how deeply Mr. Falwell was enmeshed in Mr. Cohen’s and Mr. Trump’s world. Mr. Falwell has said there were no compromising photographs, and the person close to them, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, said the Falwells “did not know anything about Mr. Cohen’s alleged efforts” on their behalf. Mr. Falwell’s endorsement of Mr. Trump, the person said, was made after careful consideration. Mr. Cohen, he said, “did not try to exert any inappropriate pressure.” Mr. Falwell began to grow close to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen after Mr. Trump came to speak at Liberty, in Lynchburg, Va., in 2012. Mr. Cohen had kept in close touch with the Falwells after Mr. Trump’s 2012 visit. Around that time, Mr. Falwell was coming under heavy pressure to get behind Mr. Trump, according to someone who spoke to Mr. Falwell then. What’s more, he said, Mr. Cohen “did nothing more than ask” Mr. Falwell to endorse Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump sought to make Mr. Falwell his secretary of education, Mr. Falwell has said. The complaint, first reported by BuzzFeed News several months after it was filed, asserted that “verbal offers were made to Granda to provide him with financial assistance.” Mr. Falwell, the complaint read, “indicated that he wanted to help Granda establish a new career and build a business” as the Falwells’ relationship with Mr. Granda “evolved.” In his sworn affidavit, Mr. Falwell said the family had made Mr. Granda a co-manager of the LLC in return for serving as its local representative. Mr. Falwell saw the hostel as a good opportunity to introduce his son and Mr. Granda to real estate investing, according to the person close to the family. Mr. Falwell has granted only one interview about the Arnold recording, to Todd Starnes of Fox News Radio, telling him there were “no compromising or embarrassing photos,” and saying, “We never engaged or paid Cohen to represent us in any legal or other professional capacity.” The new details about the lead-up to his endorsement of Mr. Trump have not affected Mr. Falwell’s continued enthusiastic support.\n",

The evening rally, a supersize version of the “Make America Great Again” rallies Mr. Trump has been staging in red states since the beginning of his presidency, was meant to energize the president and consolidate support in a must-win state where Mr. Trump’s numbers are still softer than his advisers would like them to be. But the vibe — the red caps and campaign slogan, a refreshed but familiar playlist featuring “Eye of the Tiger” and “My Way” on loop, an invocation by the megachurch pastor Paula White — was that Mr. Trump and his supporters really wanted to relive their surprise 2016 victory . Mr. Trump’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, was the first, reminiscing about the now iconic escalator ride four years ago in Trump Tower when Mr. Trump announced his candidacy.

      "summary: While Trump did turn out the universe of voters who score high on measures of racial resentment and what political scientists call “anti-black affect,” he also generated a boomerang effect. In a working paper, “Trumped by Race: Explanations for Race’s Influence on Whites’ Votes in 2016,” Andrew Engelhardt, a postdoctoral research associate in International and Public Affairs at Brown, makes the case that the percentage of racially liberal white Democrats grew from 19 percent in 2012 to 40 percent in 2016, as shown in the accompanying chart. Positive view of blacks (least resentment) Negative view of blacks (most resentment) Democrats 2012 2016 10% 8 6 4 2 LEVEL OF RESENTMENT: LEAST MOST 19% 28% 40% 18% of 2012 Democrats of 2016 Democrats Republicans 2012 2016 12 10 8 6 4 2 LEVEL OF RESENTMENT: LEAST MOST 2% 51% 3% 48% of 2012 Republicans of 2016 Republicans Positive view of blacks (least resentment) Negative view of blacks (most resentment) Democrats Republicans 2012 2016 2012 2016 12% 10% 10 8 8 6 6 4 4 2 2 LEVEL OF RESENTMENT: LEAST MOST 19% 28% 40% 18% 2% 51% 3% 48% of 2012 Democrats of 2016 Democrats of 2012 Republicans of 2016 Republicans By Bill Marsh/The New York Times | Source: analysis of American National Election Studies survey data by Andrew M. Engelhardt, Brown University Conversely, the percentage of racially resentful white Republicans fell slightly, from 51 percent in 2012 to 48 percent in 2016, a statistically insignificant difference. In an email, Engelhardt pointed out that in recent decades, “the proportion of Republicans holding more racially resentful attitudes is increasing slightly over time, but not by much.” Looking at the 16-year period from 2000 to 2016, Engelhardt wrote, “I don’t find any evidence that the distribution of racial resentment for white Republicans reliably differs between 2000 and 2016.” In his paper, Engelhardt argues that in the Trump era White nationalist rallies may gain the most attention, in part because they may play on pundits’ priors about the Trump administration’s bases of support. I’ve found, as have others, that there was a notable shift in racial resentment in 2016, but only among Democrats, who became more racially liberal on the racial resentment scale.” At the same time, one of the most striking facts to emerge from Engelhardt’s analysis is how far white Democrats have moved in a liberal direction on issues of race over the last three decades. In the period from 1988 to 1990, the level of racial resentment was almost the same among both white Democrats and white Republicans. For example, in 1988 the mean level of racial resentment, on a scale of 0 to 1, was .65 for white Republicans and .61 for white Democrats. As Hopkins wrote,  It’s clear that Trump’s support in the 2016 primaries was concentrated among Republicans who were especially concerned about immigration and who expressed higher levels of anti-Black racial prejudice. Going into 2020, Trump has clearly decided to continue and expand upon his 2016 strategy of mobilizing white voters high in anti-black affect, strongly opposed to immigration and resistant to liberalizing social mores — just as Democrats are aiming to turn out Obama voters who sat out 2016.\n",

Almost every day since the revolution that paved the way for Mr. Morsi’s election, I have worked on a draft obituary in my head for another former president I had assumed would die first: Hosni Mubarak. Many forces were still stacked against him when he took office: Just two days before the second round of the 2012 presidential election that brought him to power, for instance, Egypt’s highest court, composed of judges appointed by Mr. Mubarak, dissolved the country’s Islamist-dominated parliament, among other maneuvers — a show of strength by the old regime that would seek to undermine Mr. Morsi over the course of his presidency. Still, critics of Mr. Morsi — I was one of them — lamented that he was preoccupied with consolidating power for the Muslim Brotherhood movement from which he came, rather than acting as the transitional president they elected him to be. After three days of mass protests, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a man promoted by Mr. Morsi to head the military and to serve as defense minister, and who is now the president, overthrew the Morsi government. Mr. Mubarak was never held accountable for the killing of some 900 people in the 11 days of the uprising, just as Mr. el-Sisi and other senior security personnel are unlikely to ever be held accountable for the massacre, soon after Mr. Morsi’s overthrow, of at least 817 people in just one day, when soldiers and police violently broke up two sit-ins of mostly Muslim Brotherhood supporters, in Cairo on Aug. 14, 2013. Decimated as it is, however, the Muslim Brotherhood is unlikely to be able to pull off mass protests in Egypt, where protests became all but impossible under a draconian law passed soon after Mr. el-Sisi came to power. This, too, is what Mr. el-Sisi has achieved: From July 2013, when Mr. Morsi was overthrown, and January 2016, when the Egyptian parliament reconvened, between 16,000 and 41,000 people, most supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood, were reportedly arrested or detained.\n",

The United Nations-backed anti-corruption and impunity commission in Guatemala, known by its acronym CICIG, working in tandem with a justice system led by Attorney General Thelma Aldana, had achieved what had seemed nearly impossible, demonstrating that powerful politicians weren’t always above the law. Mr. Giammattei is backed by former military officers loyal to the former president Pérez Molina, still in prison, and to President Jimmy Morales. (According to CICIG, over the past two elections, Guatemalan political parties have received 50 percent of their funding from organized crime and corruption.) If Ms. Aldana had run, she would have been the only anti-establishment candidate to favor renewing CICIG’s mandate. Barring some shocking twist, such as either Ms. Torres or Mr. Giammattei suddenly vowing to support CICIG in a ploy to win votes while betraying their most powerful supporters — and, at least in Ms. Torres’s case, positioning herself to face a future trial — this election means the end of the commission’s work in Guatemala. “The country will remain under the control of the mafias that succeeded in ousting CICIG, thanks only to the support of Trump, ” Manfredo Marroquín, the head of Acción Ciudadana, a Guatemalan NGO, and one of this election’s few promising, low-name-recognition presidential candidates, representing a marginal political party, told me. This Guatemalan election is a manifestation of the disrespect for fundamental democratic values, institutions and the rule of law, and of a contempt for international initiatives, shared by Mr. Morales and Mr. Trump and their supporters, a true coproduction.\n",

      "summary: More Americans are saying they need a variety of animals — dogs, ducks, even insects — for their mental health. Many Americans say living with an emotional support animal has done wonders for their mental health. So Mr. Myers bought a duck and named it Primadonna. “A true service animal is a highly trained dog,” said Tammy Townley, a state representative in Oklahoma who supports her state’s new law. “When someone comes in with an emotional support animal, they are saying, ‘It’s my service animal.’ No — it’s something you bought a vest for.” Advocates point out that therapy animals are protected by the Fair Housing Act, which requires landlords to make “reasonable accommodations” for people with disabilities, like a wheelchair-accessible parking space. “When is it an emotional support animal and when it is a pet?” Sam Killebrew, a Florida state lawmaker who sponsored a bill to curb emotional support animal claims, said he went online and registered Ophelia, a stuffed baboon in his office, as his “emotional support animal,” even though she’s been frozen, her fang-filled mouth agape, by a taxidermist. Some people who require Seeing Eye dogs have complained that their animals have been attacked in airports or restaurants by untrained emotional support dogs, and that the explosion in support animals has led to more skepticism of true service dogs. Mr. Dietz does not deny that some people pretend to need an animal when they merely want one.\n",

      "summary: By Matthew Continetti Mr. Continetti is editor in chief of The Washington Free Beacon. More important, Mr. Trump benefits from incumbency and continued economic recovery, and he’s riding a wave of national populism that has yet to crest. And the economic recovery that began in mid-2009 has continued under Mr. Trump, with unemployment at half-century lows. But Mr. Trump is wary of foreign entanglements, and a slowdown is not the same as a recession. Nor is Mr. Trump likely to. Behind the rise of outsider politicians such as Mr. Trump are the interrelated issues of unchecked immigration, terrorism and the imposition of carbon taxes and other measures to mitigate climate change. After San Bernardino, Mr. Trump welded the issues of terrorism and immigration in his call for a ban on Muslims’ entry into the United States. It is the idea on which Mr. Trump and his anti-elitist supporters base their campaigns.\n",

      "summary: Then, in a poll last week, the Greens received 26 percent, topping Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, which came in at 25 percent, and making the Greens the leading political party. In the public eye, Angela Merkel, though still chancellor, has practically abdicated political leadership since December, when Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer took over leadership of the ruling Christian Democrats. Daring yet prudent, Ms. Merkel came to embody the self-image a majority of Germans craved. Now with Ms. Merkel on the way out, the public is not going to stick with the Christian Democrats. The one party coming closest to Merkelism is — you guessed it — the Green party. And for all the hype about Ms. Merkel as a climate chancellor, Germany will miss its 2020 climate goals. But it’s one thing for a nonaligned pragmatist like her to don that environmental mantle; it’s another for a party to come in promising to make climate change the core of its agenda. But turning attitude into policies might prove harder for the Green party than is has been for the green chancellor.\n",

      "summary: New York’s public transportation system loses $240 million a year because of fare evasion on the subway and buses, according to Governor Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo’s plan: Put 500 uniformed officers on bus routes and in subway stations. Mr. Cuomo wants to address two problems: fare evasion and assaults on transit workers. The governor has announced three tactics: Starting Monday, according to a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, 500 uniformed officers will be sent to 50 subway stations and 50 bus routes where evasion and assaults occur at elevated rates. Two hundred are New York Police Department officers, and 300 are M.T.A. How will they deter fare evasion? officials would “be a presence to deter people from going into the subway station.” Mr. Vance had announced last year that he would stop prosecuting these cases because fare evasion would be best solved through deterrence. How will video cameras be used to deter fare evasion? Transit officials are “going to research how to use video cameras,” Mr. Cuomo said. “The growing problem of fare evasion is just one reason we’re excited for our new OMNY fare payment system, which will ultimately provide proof of payment on subway and buses,” Mr. Foye said.\n",

      "summary: Advertisement Supported by By Andrew E. Kramer MOSCOW — International prosecutors on Wednesday said that four men, including three with close ties to the Russian military and intelligence, would face murder charges in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine five years ago, killing 298 people. The charges, based on a lengthy investigation conducted by officials of five countries affected by the disaster — the Netherlands, Malaysia, Ukraine, Belgium and Australia — expands on earlier reports about the Russian hand in the separatist faction in eastern Ukraine that has been fighting a civil war against government forces. The following year, the Joint Investigation Team, formed with prosecutors from Austria, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine, traced the missile launcher’s route from Russia to Ukraine and back. Fifteen months after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing 298 people, investigators released two conflicting reports. The missile belonged to an active-duty unit in the Russian military, the 53rd Antiaircraft Brigade based in the city of Kursk, the Dutch investigators said. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in arming separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine or in shooting down the Malaysia Airlines flight.\n",

      "summary: “Most golf parties, I don’t want to go to,” Mr. Malbon said. “Kids that are into fashion, hip-hop and music, they’re not into golf,” said Mr. Malbon. “I was doing events at Fred Segal with youth brands, and I was like, ‘I don’t want to be here,’” Mr. Malbon said. “It’s not like you’re going to be D.J.ing at an underground club anymore.” “I don’t go to clubs,” Mr. Malbon said. I want to go to country clubs early, in the morning.” In 2012, Mr. Malbon started a golf-dedicated Instagram account, “because people in his daily life were like, ‘Dude, stop posting photos of golf, none of us golf,’” Ms. Malbon said. “The haters are like, ‘This is not golf,’ ‘Don’t wear Jordans golfing.’” “Like skintight, dry-fit pants and dry-fit polos are golf,” said Mr. Malbon. The game of golf needs more of those personalities.” “There’s a lot more guys like me on the tour that would like to come to a party like this,” he added, “instead of a place where they have to wear a button-up shirt.” An unbuttoned philosophy governs the Malbon Golf Club, founded in May, a collective of L.A.-area golfers who plan to compete, monthly, on a municipal course, “so you don’t have to pay $300,000 to be able to play with a good group of people and have a good time,” Ms. Malbon said. “There are a lot of people like me, who, just because I want to join my dad’s country club, doesn’t mean I want to act like he did,” said Mr. Malbon.\n",
